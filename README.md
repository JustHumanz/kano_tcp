if you want to install on your pc you need install   [im2a](https://github.com/tzvetkoff/im2a) and you can start this tools,this tools will convert randomly in /img/ directory

all of 256-color terminal color was supported and work perfectly in gnu/linux terminal and macOS terminal,idk in windows terminal *tbh i don't care lol

#### example
you can use nc(netcat) or telnet but i recommended use nc
```nc justhumanz.me 2525``` or ```telnet justhumanz.me 2525```  
if you want print a pixel format just add ```pixel``` parameters  
```echo 'pixel' | nc justhumanz.me 2525```
